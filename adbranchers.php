<b>Welcome to the Science Library</b><br>
<br>
The Library of the Ceylon University College was initiated hundred years ago, in 1921, as a small collection of documents maintained at the College House to serve the then two departments, Science and Arts. In early 1950s, after transferring the Science Collection to the Faculty premises, departmental level libraries were established in the Departments of Botany, Chemistry, Mathematics, Physics and Zoology. In 1984, the Library, Faculty of Science was established as one of the two branch libraries of the Main Library, University of Colombo. It was housed in the ‘Old Royal College Building’ in the Faculty premises from 1992 to end of 2020.<br>
<br>
In the 21 st of January, 2021, when the Faculty of Science celebrates a century of excellence in its services to the nation, the Library was shifted to its new multistory building and adopted the name ‘Information and Learning Centre’ (ILC) to suit its scope of modern services that reach beyond the simple notion of a library. The contemporary learning zones and futuristic facilities of the ILC provide the learner community with a unique experience and a conducive environment for an engaging learning experience. 
<br><br>
Learning spaces in the ILC are specifically designed to match with different learning styles of students, and include zones for reading, quiet study, collaborative study, interactive study and open study. Additionally, the library skills lab, e-resource centre and the library studio provide admirable modern facilities which would inspire and enhance students’ abilities to discover, experience, study and research.
